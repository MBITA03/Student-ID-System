# Student-ID-System
This project provides a simple web application that generates ID Cards for students. Student's details need to be entererd in the system first, then the system offers two options: users can either upload an existing image file or capture a new one using the webcam.  Once the image is uploaded the ID is generated after searching the exam number.
